# Follow the Path #

[Demo](https://MERNCraft.github.io/path)

In this CSS-only game, you must click on the green start button then move your mouse along the grey path to the red finish button. You can click on gold tokens on the way to increase your score.

Clicking the finish button, or moving your mouse off the path ends the game. There are three different end-game messages. The one you see depends on whether you went off the path or reached the finish button, and whether you collected all the gold tokens on the way.

This game was designed as a challenge for you to practise your CSS skills.

The `main` branch does not show the score or your time. This is an "exercise for the reader". The repository contains a file called `counters.css`, where you can add your own CSS.

If want to see one solution for this, you can checkout the `solution` branch. 

If you need help in understanding the concepts, you can read [this tutorial on CSS counters](https://MERNCraft.github.io/). This game was specifically written to accompany this tutorial.
