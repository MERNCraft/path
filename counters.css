/* Add your own CSS here, in order to:

1. Show the Score as a number
2. Show an emoji whose expression changes as the Score increases
   (Hint — you can use this set of emojis, if you like:
    "😔" "🙁" "😕" "😒" "😌" "🙂" "😀" "😄" "😁" "😊" "😞"
   )
3. Create a timer to show the Time since the player clicked on
   the .start .button. Note that you will have to count more
   than 10 seconds... but players should finish the game (or
   get bored with it) in less than 100 seconds
4. Stop the timer when the player moves the mouse off the path
   or when they click on the .finish .button.

Have fun!
